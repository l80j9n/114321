What is this course   about?
Summary of the course
Welcome to the   114321   (Talent    Performance   Management) Course!Effective   people   management   serves   as   a   cornerstone   of   organisational   success.   This   is   often   achieved      through      well-integrated      and      efficient      HR      policies      and      practices.      These      include   appropriate   interventions   in such areas as   recruitment and selection; training   and   management   development; job grading   and   pay;   health   and safety; diversity   and   inclusion   management; and   compliance with employment law. These issues are fundamental to the work of   HR practitioners   and are addressed   in course   114241 (Principles   of   HRM).Organisations   seek   talented   individuals   and   look   for   new   ways   to    manage   them.   A   talented   workforce   is   crucial   to   execute   strategy   and   achieve   organizational   performance.   This   focus   is   more    important    given   the      recent    changes    in    the    world    of    work    (e.g.,    work    disruptions    and   technological advancement) and the resultant need to secure new   skills   to   maintain competitive   advantage.   Building   on   the   HR   insights   from   114241,   this   course   focuses   on   proactive   ways   to   manage   high-potential   and   high-performing   employees.   Talent   management   is   a   strategic   and   contemporary   approach   to    attracting,    identifying,    developing,   and    retaining    individuals   with   exceptional   skills   and   abilities.   This   is   a   systematic   approach   involving   strategic   work   analysis,   managing talent   pipelines, and creating a learning culture.   In this way, organisations   ensure that   they have the right workforce to meet immediate needs and deliver on future strategic direction.This      course      examines      the      theory      and      practice      of       managing      talent      and      performance      in   contemporary   contexts.   The   subject   requires   an   attitude   of   scholarship   on   your   part,   that   is,   close    engagement    with    the    literature    (recommended      readings)      and      a      preparedness      to      ask   questions   and   actively   engage   in   discussion.   However,   you   should   find   the   material   interesting   as well as   sometimes   challenging!In    summary,    this    course    explores    talent    management    as    a    strategic      approach    to      achieving   organisational   goals.   Particular   emphasis   is   given   to   organisations   '   responses   to   trends   in   both   their internal and external   environment.

Relationship to other courses
The   prerequisite course for   114321   is   114241   (Principles of   HRM). The general   prerequisite   is   at   least 45 credits from the   200-level.114321   is   part   of   the   major   in   Human   Resource   Management   and   Employment   Relations.   It   is   one   of the advanced specialist courses   in the   major. Where   other courses   in   the   major   focus   on   specific techniques and theories that   HR practitioners use, this course considershow these might   be   used to   manage a talented   workforce within the strategic context   of   organisations.
Course   role   in the development of programme   learning   goalsBusiness   programmes   at   Massey   aim   to   help   students   learn   to   be   independent   and   analytical   thinkers       who       can       communicate       effectively.          Managing       Talent              Performance          (114321)   contributes   to   these   goals   by   developing   the   skill   of   applying   HR   concepts   and   techniques   in   proactive ways that   build and   maintain talent to fulfill   (and even shape)   the   strategic   needs   and   intentions   of   organisations.   A   traditional   and   reactive   HR   approach   lacks   the   agility   to   respond   to   the   dynamic   business   environment.   The   course   helps   students   develop   the   ability   to   think   through strategic   implications and communicate their insights to   other   decision-makers.

Communicating   with   each   otherFurther to our interaction in   the lectures (Auckland and   Palmerston   North   internal   students) and   on   Zoom   (distance   learning   students),   the   primary   means   of   communication   are   the       Stream   forums. These   can   be   found   under   the   Keeping   in   Touch/Paepaekδrerotabin   the   course   Stream site.   Please      use   these   forums   to   communicate   with   us, rather   than   contacting   usvia   email. This is because messages from individual student email accounts are sometimes misidentified by Massey   email systems as spam and   filtered out   – ensure we hear   from   you by communicating via the   Stream   forums. There are      several forums, each with a different   purpose. They include:News   forum   : This   is   a   one-way   forum   for   you   from   our   side.

Communication expectations
As   Massey's guidelines stipulate, we expect everyone   in the   Massey   community to   communicate courteously, appropriately, and constructively   in all   exchanges.
In terms of specific   messages, it's   essential to   be   clear   from   the   outset   both   what   we   expect   of   you and what you can   expect of   us.   Here   is what   you   can   reasonably   expect   of   us:
•          responses   to   all   discussion   forum   postings   within   48   hours   during   the   working   week      (Monday-Friday);
•          responses to any   personal communication within 48   hours during the working week.   Within   reason, we also   have a couple   of   expectations   of you:
•   use a meaningful subject   line   in your discussion   postings;
•   use the Stream discussion forums appropriately;
•   support   your   colleagues   in the   course – that   means   encouraging,   helping,   and   respecting your      fellow students.
